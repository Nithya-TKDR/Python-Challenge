# UCI Bootcamp - Module 3 Python Challenge
**Brief Summary**: In this project, Python scripting is used to complete two separate challenges, PyBank and Pypoll, as outlined below:
    1) **PyBank**: In this assignment, a simple financial dataset of a company organized as a CSV file is used to analyze and help provide basic insights. The actual desired format of the output along with the desired values is described in the corresponding source code file. The output is written to both the terminal and an output TXT file in a separate folder in the parent directory of this script. 
    2) **PyPoll**: In this assignment, polling data of a small rural town organized as a CSV file is used to analyze the votes and help provide insights around votes for each candidate and also the winner of the election based on popular vote. The actual desired format of the output along with the desired values is described in the corresponding source code file. The output is written to both the terminal and an output TXT file in a separate folder in the parent directory of this script.
